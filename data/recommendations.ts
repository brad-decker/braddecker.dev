    text: `Brad has been my most valuable mentor over the past four years and I would highly recommend him for both leadership and deeply technical roles.
    As a leader, Brad is committed to instilling and maintaining a culture of best practices and high standards. He advocates passionately for what he considers the best path forward but also believes in getting buy-in from his team. He is quick to see the advantage to his team and the company of adopting new technology and eager to mentor others on how to leverage it effectively. Brad is an inspirational leader and a bulwark of a healthy developer experience.
    Even after taking on substantial managerial responsibilities, Brad kept himself up to date on the evolution of the application and its dependencies and remained the final authority on solving thorny issues. He is as comfortable diving into the codebase himself as he is delegating work and mentoring others. The impressive breadth and depth of his theoretical and practical knowledge of modern application development has been instrumental to the development of our product and team.`,

    text: `I've been in web development for 25 years, as a Senior Software Engineer for 22 of them, since the dotcom era, and I've been under a lot of managers -- and Brad is definitely in the top tier. Knowledgeable, patient, respectful and encouraging, eloquent, and wicked smart.
    He somehow multitasked between directing our development team -- paying close attention to what we're doing and how we're coding, and working for improvements in our processes, i.e. integrating our needs as engineers with what the company needs us to produce -- as well as contributing almost the amount of code as a full-time engineer. I suspect there's a clone involved somewhere.
    Brad was *definitely* not one of those managers who coded back in the day, and feels like they're still current but aren't really: he is a subject matter expert in everything I've seen him do here, and I learned much from his peer-reviewed code, his help when he's peer-reviewed mine, and when we've pair programmed.
    It was a pleasure to work with Brad, and I wish it hadn't ended so soon, when our office was unfortunately closed. `,

    text: `Brad and I became acquainted while I was a Technical Mentor (Hacker in Residence) at Hack Reactor (now Galvanized). He delivered an introduction to GraphQL to a room full of eager students and faculty. His reputation as an established contributor to and evangelist of Open Source JS preceded him. After the talk Brad was kind enough to exchange contact information with me and we continued a conversation about GraphQL and other open source JS tech of interest to us both. A couple months later Brad and I were working together at Concierge Auctions.
    As in fledgeling open source technology, so-to with fledgeling developers, Brad has a proven passion for cultivating the people and projects he believes in. Over my years working with Brad, I learned that for Brad to take professional interest in me was more than a contractual arrangement, it was a commitment to my growth as an engineer. This manifested in countless conversations, thorough code reviews, technical and non-technical mentorship, and a constant sense that "he had my back."
    I appreciate Brad for all of that. He has played an important role in my development in to the engineer that I am today.  `,
