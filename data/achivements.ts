    primary: 'Implemented Multi-tenant configuration system',
    secondary: `After launching our first customer on our platform we had to focus on how we scaled the product to more than one customer. We had always built with that intent in mind, but it wasn't until we gave it every ounce of focus did we cross the chasm between one and two customers. During this time I implemented the core of our multi-tenant configuration system that allowed us to go from one site to seven in just under a week.`,

    primary: 'Led Adoption of the Collaborative Operating System',
    secondary: `One of my proudest moments as a leader was leading the team towards a fully collaborative style of decision making. I faced personal challenges along the way as I changed my leadership tact, and started focusing on driving ownership and alignment above even my own ideas and solutions. The result has been phenomenal, solutions are not only better but everyone understands the why behind them.`,

    primary: 'Launched First Brokerage on our Platform',
    secondary: `There is nothing quite like launching your product for the first time. Our goal with the platform was to reach feature parity with a brokerage so that we could replace their technology, this did not give us a lot of room to budge on scope. As a result we were running behind schedule and our small team was frantically fixing bugs and polishing features. Getting everyone moving in the same direction, and inspiring my team by being right there  with them, squashing bugs, was exhilarating and deeply rewarding.`,

    primary: 'Helped fix a memory leak in Next.js and React',
    secondary: `One of the bugs that was holding up our first product launch was a pretty massive memory leak. All of the engineering teams were occupied fixing other bugs or resolving the last acceptance criteria for features needed for launch, so I took on the memory leak. My journey led me all the way down into the React internals and I worked with the React and Next.js teams to identify the source of the memory leak. A new version of Next.js and React were released that patched the issue and we were able to launch without a hitch.`,
